# Quizzical App built with React

Warning: Vite enforces using jsx syntax inside jsx/tsx files, so it will complain about that. Solution: rename `.js` files to `.jsx` :)

Quick start:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start

## About Quizzical

The app was built solely using React. I have the index.jsx file as the src file for the index.html file. The App.jsx is rendered in the index.jsx file, and it has three components that were used to build it.

The Quizzical app fetches questions and answer options from an Api and displays. The player selects options that they feel match the questions, and check the answers. The app grades the player, and scores him. The player has the option to play the multiple times.
