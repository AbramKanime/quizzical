## About Quizzical App

The app is designed to fetch questions from an Api for every round of game played, and display the question and answer options randomly. The player selects the likely answers to the questions, and clicks the "Check answers" button, which then shows by coloring the answers they got correct/wrong while coloring the right answers.
The player can replay the game multiply times.

You are welcome to leave notes for code optimizations for me!
